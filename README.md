Thus R package works with US airline cost datasets and includes three functions I created:
It lets you:

- calculate the average cost: avg_cost()
- find the highest cost row: highest_cost()
- make a plot showing how cost changes over time; plot_Cost_over_time()
  
This package was created using the US airline cost dataset (USAirliness.csv), and the the data loads in with data(airdata)
and each function uses that dataset to generate a specific function.
The purpose of this package is to analyze airline cost trends in a more simple way without making
it complicated.

This is actually my first time creating an R package and learning how it works and I find it cool
how we just document and add things ourselves.
